 * Unique Paths II Total Accepted: 29470 Total Submissions: 105110 My Submissions Question Solution 
  Follow up for "Unique Paths":

  Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

  An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

  For example,
  There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

  [
    [0,0,0],
    [0,1,0],
    [0,0,0]
  ]
  The total number of unique paths is 2.
  解题思路：
  这道题，跟Unique Paths的递推公式一样
  只是在障碍物的地方res[j] = 0;
