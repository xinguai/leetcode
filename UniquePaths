 * nique Paths Total Accepted: 38363 Total Submissions: 117468 My Submissions Question Solution 
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

 Note: m and n will be at most 100.
 解题思路：
 用动态规划，迭代公式为：
 A(i,j) = m(i, j-1) + m(i-1,j)
 空间复杂度O(n)就可以

        res[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i){
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j)
                res[j] += res[j-1];
        }
        
        return res[n -1];
    }
